<h1>Incident-Handler's-Journal</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this activity, we were given a blank Incident Handler's Jouranl and were tasked with filling it in as we progressed through the course. I used my journal to record a cybersecurity incidnet, a phishing alert, a packet capture, and an investigation of a suspicious file hash.

| 1         | Documenting a cybersecurity incident | N/A              | - **Who caused the incident?** An organized group of unethical hackers<br>- **What happened?** The company’s files were encrypted and the group demanded money to decrypt the files.<br>- **When did the incident occur?** Tuesday 9:00am<br>- **Where did the incident happen?** A small U.S. healthcare clinic<br>- **Why did the incident happen?** A malicious file was downloaded through a phishing email. The file gave the group of hackers access to the company’s files which is when they launched their ransomware attack. As they are demanding money, their motivations appear to be financial gain.  | - What are the current protocols that deal with phishing?<br>- Did the employee have proper training to recognize phishing emails? |

| 2         | Documenting a phishing alert        | N/A              | - **Who caused the incident?** The email was sent from “Def communications,” but it is also from someone named "Clyde West."<br>- **What happened?** An employee received an email with a malicious file attached.<br>- **When did the incident occur?** Wednesday, July 20, 2022, 09:30:14 AM<br>- **Where did the incident happen?** Presumably on a work computer.<br>- **Why did the incident happen?** Clyde West most likely intended for the employee to download a malicious file to access sensitive information. | - What did the employee due upon recieving this email? <br> - Investigate the current email filtering system to determine if it could have flagged or prevented this malicious email from reaching this employee.  |

Capturing and filtering network traffic with Tcpdump was very fun. |

## Reflections/Notes
| **Reflection** |
|----------------|
| **Were there any specific activities that were challenging for you? Why or why not?**<br>Personally, I found using Splunk and Chronicle the most challenging part of the course. This was because I was new to the interface and felt overwhelmed at times. By focusing on the interface bit by bit and following the instructions, I was able to work through the tough parts.<br><br>**Has your understanding of incident detection and response changed after taking this course?**<br>My understanding of incident detection and response has dramatically increased after this course. Initially, I had a surface-level understanding. After learning about various tools and gaining hands-on experience, I now have a much deeper understanding, though my learning journey is far from over.<br><br>**Was there a specific tool or concept that you enjoyed the most? Why?**<br>I really enjoyed using Tcpdump because I find using the command line interface fun. The command line interface has always intrigued me, and I enjoy any opportunity to use the skills that I have worked hard to hone. |
